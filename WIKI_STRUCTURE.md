## Implementation Notes

### For GitHub Wiki Creation:
1. Create wiki pages in the suggested order (high-priority first)
2. Use consistent naming (kebab-case for URLs)
3. Cross-link related pages extensively
4. Include code examples with proper syntax highlighting
5. Add screenshots for UI-heavy sections (Synology, API key setup)
6. Use consistent formatting and callout styles

### Content Guidelines:
- Move ALL technical details to wiki
- Keep README as marketing/overview only
- Use tables for comparing options
- Include troubleshooting in each relevant section
- Add "Last updated" dates to pages that change frequently
- Use GitHub's wiki features (sidebar navigation)

### Links in Main README:
- All wiki links use relative paths: `../../wiki/Page-Name`
- Test all links after wiki creation
- Consider adding wiki search functionality mention

This structure transforms the overwhelming 480-line README into a navigable, organized knowledge base that's much easier to maintain and use.
